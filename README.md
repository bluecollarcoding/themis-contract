# Themis Contract ðŸ–‹

**PROTOTYPE**: Note that `themis-contract` is a prototype right now. All code on
this branch is to be considered highly experimental. No semantic versioning will
be used just yet: at present, a `v0.2.x` series is being released. Breaking
changes can be released at any time.

If you're looking for the TypeScript-based prototype, it's currently on the
`prototype/v1` branch.

## Overview

Themis Contract is a prototype tool to help with legal contracting. It currently
aims to:

1. Make contracting modular (in a decentralized way).
2. Make contracting more programmatic (and eventually executable) than is
   traditionally the case.
3. Make managing contracts more like managing software (so we can leverage
   the value that software development processes offer, like version control,
   continuous integration, etc.).

## Requirements **TODO**

It's recommended right now that you use the Docker-based version of Themis
Contract. To do so you'll just need Docker installed, of course.

This is currently only being tested on macOS and Linux.

## Installation

### Dockerized **TODO**

We have a shell script that you can use locally to interact with the Docker
image on your machine. It tries to take care of many of the painful aspects of
using the Docker image, like mounting the right volumes.

```bash
# Fetch the themis-contract shell script
curl -sSL \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/informalsystems/themis-contract/master/scripts/themis-contract \
    -o /usr/local/bin/themis-contract

# Make the script executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/themis-contract

# Test it's installed correctly
themis-contract --version
```

### From source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:informalsystems/themis-contract.git
cd themis-contract/cmd/themis-contract
go install
```

Contract to get the most out of it:
